"""An integration for PCSensor devices, specifically, TEMPer sensors

Note that the TEMPer sensors have a flaw in them and can report
inaccurate temperatures, getting "stuck" at one point or another.
This goes beyond mere digital granularity, but is an actual problem
that misreports temperatures at times.

Nevertheless, it's what I have currently, and using it is better than
nothing.
